# T480-oc

OpenCore configuration for the Lenovo Thinkpad T480

## Disclaimer

This configuration, probably, won't break your laptop. Only probably though. Actually, I'm sure it won't, but please, pretty pretty please go build your own EFI. It'll help you in the longterm because you'll know how your configuration works, and how to fix it should you run in to any issues.

In fact, this is exactly the reason this repository exists in the first place. Someone already put an OC config for pretty much the exact build of the laptop I have here in front of me on GH, but I'm building my own because I want to know how it functions completely and built it for the exact purposes I need.

If you still insist on using this configuration, feel free, but please don't make issues about BC wi-fi not working for example, I use an intel card and don't need it hence why it won't work for you. You can fork this and add support for that, or, once again, build your own EFI.

If you do find any issues you think are worth fixing however, do feel free to let me know and I'll have a look.
